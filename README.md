### Practical Deep Learning Projects

Based on: Introduction to Deep and Machine Learning
Instructor: Dr. Mohammad Hossein Rohban
Course: Rayan International AI Contest Preparation â€“ SUT
ðŸ“š Course Overview

This repository contains practical deep learning projects developed as part of the "Introduction to Deep and Machine Learning" course led by Dr. Mohammad Hossein Rohban. The course provides a rigorous foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of deep learning and modern AI techniques, preparing participants for competitive AI challenges.

### Key Concepts Covered

The projects and notes in this repo are rooted in the following deep-learning topics:

- Statistical Foundations of Machine Learning
- Computational Graphs & Optimization Techniques
- Self-supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- Representation Learning
- Generative Models:
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Diffusion Models
- Computer Vision:
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
   - Image Classification and Feature Extraction
- Transfer Learning & Fine-tuning Techniques


### These three projects are implemented as Jupyter notebooks, each containing detailed explanations, comments, and notes that describe the purpose of the exercises and how the provided solutions contribute to achieving the desired results.
